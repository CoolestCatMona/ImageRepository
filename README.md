# Image Repository

This website acts as a private image hosting repository for remote image loading through various web applications.

## Image Hosting and Updating

This repo publishes to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free hosting of the images and captions. When the files in the "Web" directory are edited, the website is re-published. As long as the filenames stay the same (images are 1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc.) - any URLs referenced will point to the newly published files. Republishing happens automatically through [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) defined in [filename](google.com).
